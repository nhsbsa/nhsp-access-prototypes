                    <p>To use some digital services, the government needs to check you are who you say you are. GOV.UK Verify gives you simple access to services like checking your state pension or driving licence details.&nbsp;</p>

                    <h4>It’s safe and secure</h4>

                    <p>GOV.UK Verify has been developed by the Government Digital Service (GDS) and meets the highest levels of international standards for security and data protection. With GOV.UK Verify, you can be confident your identity is protected.</p>

                    <p>Partner companies assure your identity. This means the government never needs to see your personal information and the partner companies never know which service you’re using.</p>

                    <h4>It gives you access to services you use</h4>

                    <p>You only need to register with GOV.UK Verify once. You’ll then be able to quickly and easily access government services. You’ll be able to securely log in with your username.</p>

                    <h4>It’s simple to use</h4>

                    <ol>
                        <li>You’ll be asked some questions to work out which partner companies are most likely to be able to verify your identity</li>
                        <li>You then choose from a list of carefully selected partner companies who can verify your identity</li>
                        <li>They ask you some questions to establish it’s really you. For example, you might be asked for information about your passport or driving licence</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>None of this data is seen by government or stored centrally. It’s the best way to protect your information and to keep things simple, safe and secure.</p>

                    <p>There are a number of ways our partners check your identity including: driver’s licence, passport or answering a question based on your credit history.</p>

                    <p>There’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify">more information about GOV.UK Verify</a> available on their website.</p>
